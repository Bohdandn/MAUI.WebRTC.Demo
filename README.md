# MAUI.WebRTC.Demo
Demo project to try WebRTC native bindings in .net MAUI.
There are two projects with Xamarin bindings
- https://github.com/melihercan/WebRTCme
- https://github.com/dmariogatto/xamarin-webrtc

Binding libraries are based on https://github.com/dmariogatto/xamarin-webrtc

How to build via CLI from windows:
- dotnet workload install maui-android maui-ios
- On remote mac: dotnet workload install maui-ios
- Check that versions of workloads are similar othewise reinstall with updated workload manifest
- cd \src\MauiSampleApp
- dotnet build -f:net6.0-android
- dotnet build -f:net6.0-ios /p:ServerAddress={remote mac ip} /p:ServerUser={mac user name} /p:ServerPassword={mac user pw} /p:TcpPort=58181

## Status
### Android
Android working perfectly without any modifications from CLI and VS.

### iOS
iOS ApiDefinitions.cs was modified in order to complie:
- AutoGeneratedName = true - removed
- [iOS(10, 0)] - commented
- new RTCVideoCodecInfo[] SupportedCodecs { get; } - new added

#### Building from CLI
iOS working perfectly if compiled on mac os.
On windows it is failing with hundreds of similar errors for all Microsoft.iOS classes used in api definitions file:
```
C:\Program Files\dotnet\packs\Microsoft.iOS.Sdk\16.0.523\tools\msbuild\iOS\Xamarin.Shared.targets(1640,3): error CS0433: The type 'ExportAttribute' exists in both 'Microsoft.iOS, Version=16.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=84e04ff9cfb79065' and 'Microsoft.iOS, Version=15.4.300.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=84e04ff9cfb79065' [C:\XXX\src\WebRtc.iOS\WebRtc.iOS.csproj]
```
As I understand msbuild copies all referenced libraries including Microsoft.iOS.dll to remote mac. Looks like build conflicts between original sdk libraries and copied sdk libraries.

#### Building from VS
Fails with issue discribed in https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/16001.

Feel free to suggest any solutions or create PR's from forks. I will get back here time to time and try to fix iOS bindings or check if it was fixed by .net team.
